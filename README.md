# Early-Stage-Detection-of-Ovarian-Cancer
This college project explores machine learning to aid in early ovarian cancer detection. We applied K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT) models, plus an RF-DT ensemble for enhanced accuracy. Includes SMOTE to address data imbalance and performance metrics for a thorough evaluation.
