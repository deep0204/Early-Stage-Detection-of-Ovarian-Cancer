# Early-Stage-Detection-of-Ovarian-Cancer
This college project explores machine learning to aid in early ovarian cancer detection. We applied K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT) models, plus an RF-DT ensemble for enhanced accuracy. Includes SMOTE to address data imbalance and performance metrics for a thorough evaluation.

Our Contributions to the existing works :
Integration of Ensemble Learning :
We implemented ensemble learning techniques by combining two well-established models, Random Forest and Decision Tree, to improve the accuracy and robustness of early-stage ovarian cancer detection.
By leveraging the strengths of both models, we achieved a more resilient prediction system, with reduced risk of overfitting and enhanced generalization capabilities.

Individual Model Performance Comparison :
Separate results from each model (Random Forest, Decision Tree, and the combined ensemble) are presented to showcase their distinct predictive abilities.
This comparative analysis allows for a transparent evaluation of each modelâ€™s contribution and highlights the added value of the ensemble approach.

Enhanced Predictive Accuracy :
The ensemble model demonstrates higher predictive accuracy compared to individual models, proving the effectiveness of our approach in handling ovarian cancer data.
We observed notable improvements in sensitivity and specificity, crucial for early-stage detection.

Beautifully Organized Results Presentation :
A clear and visually organized format is used to present the comparative results, making it easier to interpret differences between models and understand the ensemble's impact.

Reproducibility and Usability: 
Our methodology ensures reproducibility, allowing future researchers to validate and build upon our findings, especially in ovarian cancer prediction.
