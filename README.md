This college project explores machine learning to aid in early ovarian cancer detection. We applied K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT) models, plus an RF-DT ensemble for enhanced accuracy in future predeiction on un-seen data.

Our Contribution : 

Integration of Ensemble Learning : 

•⁠  ⁠We implemented ensemble learning techniques by combining two well-established models, Random Forest and Decision Tree, to improve the accuracy and robustness of early-stage ovarian cancer detection.
•⁠  ⁠By leveraging the strengths of both models, we achieved a more resilient prediction system, with reduced risk of overfitting and enhanced generalization capabilities.

Hyperparameter Tuning : 

•⁠  Optimized Model Parameters: Used GridSearchCV to systematically search for the best combination of hyperparameters across models (Random Forest, Decision Tree, etc.). This significantly boosted model performance      by identifying the best-fit parameters.

•⁠  Cross-Validation: Employed k-fold cross-validation to assess model stability and prevent overfitting, leading to more reliable generalization on unseen data.


Feature Selection and Engineering—Used model-based methods: 

•⁠ (e.g., feature importance from Random Forest or Decision Tree) to identify the most influential features, allowing for refined input and improving predictive performance.


Visualization and Interpretability : 

•⁠  Feature Importance Plotting: Visualized the top three or more most important features for each model, allowing domain experts to understand which factors most influence predictions.
•⁠  Metric Comparison Plotting: Compared model performance across various metrics in a single visualization, providing a clear and comprehensive comparison for decision-makers.
